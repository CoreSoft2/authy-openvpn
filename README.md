## How Authy VPN works

### Certificates based Auth

In this scenario user needs: username + certificate + token to login.

If you are already using certificates to authenticate your vpn users you won't
need to regenerate them. Authy uses a authy-vpn.conf were you tell
authy the users login and the AUTHY_ID.

##### Example authy-vpn.conf for a user with AUTHY_ID 10229

    user1@company.com 10229

Here the user will enter `user1@company.com` as username and the
Token(which he gets from the app) as the password. The
certificate is transparently checked before this happens.  

### Authy plugin with PAM

If you are using PAM before you can still use authy Two-Factor
Authentication.

To use PAM simply answer that you are going to use PAM during the
postinstall script.


##### Example authy-vpn.conf for a user joe with AUTHY_ID 10229

    joe 10229

Here joe is the PAM login username.

Let's suppose joe password is `god`. So the user will enter `joe` as
username, and the password concatenated with the token in the password
field. EG.

    username:joe
    password:god1234567

`1234567` would be the Token.


## Adding your first user

This section will show how to properly setup Two-Factor Authentication
on one of your users.

The Authy plugin comes with a script to help with the users
registration and creation of the authy-vpn.conf

    sudo authy_vpn_add_users

## Authy OpenVPN with Common Name Verification
### Example authy-vpn.conf for a user joe with Common Name joe1 and AUTHY_ID 10229

    joe joe1 10229

This will check that joe and the common name from the certificate
(joe1) matches before proceding with the authentication

## Client configuration

You will need to add

    auth-user-pass

to your `client.conf` this is to ensure that the OpenVPN client asks
for username and password
